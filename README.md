# CS-350

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The goal of the project was to develop code that can register and set temperatures for a thermostat. The key requirement was establishing proper interrupts and timers for the system.

# What did you do particularly well?

Throughout the course as a whole I feel like the reusability of my code from assignment to assignment was what I handled the best. Between each week there was a lot of time saved by copy/pasting code and refactoring it for the project with minor changes.

# Where could you improve?

I feel as though my diagrams/planning could have been a bit more in-depth. With this being my first time working with embedded systems it was a lot of knowledge all at once, so in the future I will be more concise and confident. I also feel like I could have added or tweaked some of the features to make my work stand out maybe even adding extra features.
	
# What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

TI and CCS come with tons of information on their resources pages that will assist in learning how embedded systems work. So I will be looking into more of their usages and the add-ons with more interaction options for the board.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

Working around embedded systems and processors is something that is only going to become more vital with the current technology trend of devices getting smaller and smaller.

# How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 

Commenting out code as much as possible, keeping the variables simple and concise. I also started looking into the projects and assignments as soon as they became available sometimes starting them the week prior. Doing this also gave me plenty of time to inevitably over think my work before the deadline.
